## About <a name="about"></a> 
Hi, I'm Pinny!I've been working as data science consultant for more than 3 yrs, so I have the experience of building up a dashboard or report from scratch. My responsibilities include preparing relevant data, combing different data sources and analyzing it using statistical techniques to get actionable insights. Then I love to utilize Tableau or Power BI to explain my finding in the easiest way. I have a proven record of creating the most user friendly dashboard. I 've  also collaborated with various business unit and department as well and I like to see people I work with able to get the most use out of my creation. 

This is a repository to showcase skills, share projects and track my progress in Data Analytics / Data Science related topics.
