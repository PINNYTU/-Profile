## About <a name="about"></a> 
Hi, I'm Pinny!I am a hard working "Data Practitioner" who loves to get my hand dirty with all the complex data that I can find. Being able to understand the data, process it, extract value from it, and come out with actionable insights, are what truly matters to me. It has always been my work ethic to explain the findings in the easiest way that non-technical users are able to understand. Being able to utilize Tableau/Power BI also help me with all presentations. Therefore, I have a proven record of creating the most user friendly dashboard. Currently, I am working on my visualization and data story telling skills to get my Tableau Data Analyst Certificate and land a data-related job in Canada. 

This is a repository to showcase skills, share projects and track my progress in Data Analytics / Data Science related topics.

## Portfolio Projects <a name="portfolio-project"></a> 
In this section I will demonstrate some of my proudest data analytics projects and describe the techniques used to solve each problem.
 * ### Market Basket Analysis 
   > Problems: Would like to know the brands that La Mer members purchase with.
   
   > Techniques: Apriori Algorithm in Association Rule Learning.
   
   > Output: Brands like Lancome, Clarins, and Estee Lauder show the highest score respectively. 
 * ### Travel Insurance Marketing Strategy 
   > Problems: Would like to if there are differences in travel habbits between customers and non-customers

      * Use Descriptive/Diagnostic analysis: Thnk of hypothesis and 
      * Reporting and visualization: Came up with story board view based on the hypothesis and used Tableau to come up with graphs. 
      * Data validation/Sanity Check: Recheck the data accuracy in by query check in SQL and compared the results with the graph from Tableau. 
      * Presentation : In this scenario the audiences is the CEO, so I only mentioned the key messages and the points that are "Must Know" and leave out the "Good to know"
